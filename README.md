# My Personal Project

## Interactive Flashcards

### What is this?
My project is an interactive flashcard system that can hold multiple sets of flashcards. Each flashcard set can have a 
category and store many flashcards. Each flashcard will be able to store a question and answer and can be marked as 
complete once the user is confident! 

Users will eventually be able to:
* play games with the flashcards
* randomize cards within the set
* create multiple choice questions
* test themselves with fill-in-the-blank exercises
* and more!

### Who is this for?
The flashcard system will be useful to any student studying multiple subjects at once.

### Why am I making this?
This project is interesting to me as I have always used flashcard tools when I studied before. I believe it would
be a very useful tool to create and tailor to my own needs.
