# My Personal Project

## Interactive Flashcards


My project is an interactive flashcard system that can hold multiple sets of flashcards. Each flashcard set can have a 
category and store many flashcards. Users will eventually be able to play games with the flashcards, such as
giving the correct answer given a prompt or multiple choice questions based on the cards.

The flashcard system will be useful to any student studying multiple subjects at once.

This project is interesting to me as I have always used flashcard tools when I studied before. I believe it would
be a very useful tool to create and tailor to my own needs.
